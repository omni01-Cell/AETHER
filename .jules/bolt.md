## 2025-06-03 - Optimizing DynamicCompressor decibel conversions
**Learning:** The DynamicCompressor was unconditionally performing expensive `log10` and `powf` operations on every single sample, even when the signal was below the compression threshold.
**Action:** Pre-calculate the linear threshold outside the inner processing loop and use a fast linear comparison (`if *env > threshold_linear`) to elide expensive decibel-space conversions.
## 2025-06-03 - Optimizing MultiTrackMixer audio mixing loop
**Learning:** Explicit indexing in inner DSP loops (`mixed[0][sample_idx] += ...`) forces Rust to perform redundant runtime bounds checks, creating a significant performance bottleneck.
**Action:** Use iterators (e.g., `iter_mut().zip()`) and slice splitting (`split_at_mut()`) on parallel buffers to completely elide bounds checks and safely handle mutable aliasing.
## 2024-05-18 - Optimize Audio Resampling
**Learning:** Pre-calculating inverse ratios and casting values to integers as a substitute for floating-point operations like `.floor()` and `.ceil()` provides significant performance boosts in hot DSP loops.
**Action:** Prioritize using integer arithmetic and invariant math extraction over built-in floating-point operations when mapping buffer indices in stateful resampling loops.
