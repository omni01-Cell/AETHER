## 2025-06-03 - Optimizing DynamicCompressor decibel conversions
**Learning:** The DynamicCompressor was unconditionally performing expensive `log10` and `powf` operations on every single sample, even when the signal was below the compression threshold.
**Action:** Pre-calculate the linear threshold outside the inner processing loop and use a fast linear comparison (`if *env > threshold_linear`) to elide expensive decibel-space conversions.
## 2025-06-03 - Optimizing MultiTrackMixer audio mixing loop
**Learning:** Explicit indexing in inner DSP loops (`mixed[0][sample_idx] += ...`) forces Rust to perform redundant runtime bounds checks, creating a significant performance bottleneck.
**Action:** Use iterators (e.g., `iter_mut().zip()`) and slice splitting (`split_at_mut()`) on parallel buffers to completely elide bounds checks and safely handle mutable aliasing.
## 2026-09-01 - Resampler optimization
**Learning:** Pre-calculating inverse ratios and using integer casting instead of floating-point `floor()` and `ceil()` can significantly speed up the inner loops of audio DSP resampling.
**Action:** Always look for opportunities to replace expensive floating-point operations in hot loops with safe integer casting and pre-calculated invariants.
